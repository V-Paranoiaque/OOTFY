## Platform support

* Android
* Blackberry 10
* Firefox OS
* iOS

## Usage

Don't forget to configure OOTFY in the configuration manu.

When a user connects to your service, you ask him an additional code. This code 
will be generated simultaneously on your server and on the user's mobile. Both 
codes will be compared to guaranteed a secured access. You can add a mechanism 
against the brute force to increase security.

With OOTFY, even if a password stolen your users are safe. An analysis of 
server's logs may detect intrusion attempt.
